Genetic algorithm for car races.

Defining the following problem: There is a car (agent) with a starting position that is able to move in anywhere in a rectangle. The field might be accesible (green) or inaccessible(red). If the agent ends up in an inaccessible region, then the is stopped and no further genes are evaluated.

The genes consist in steps. For each generation there will be breeding between the best individuals and possible mutations. The fitness function should be defined to evaluate the agents.
